# Jeopardy

A simple Jeopardy game using the publicly available [jService Jeopardy Question API](http://jservice.io/). Unfortunately, the API doesn't use secured http requests, so it won't work on github pages. But feel free to download the game and play it from a live server! Or, you can [view it on github](https://andrewtoups.github.io/jeopardy/) pages and look at the pretty CSS screen I stole from codepen.

## Todo:
* Host it somewhere so people can actually play it online.
* Improve the text parsing/error checking.
